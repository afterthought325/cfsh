Work on program flow.
Shell Starts
Input prompt is created and program waits for user input.
Input comes from user.
Split up input based on pipes.
if command is cd
    change directory
else if command is history
    print history
else 
    store line into history
    if pipes exists (aka. cmds[1] != NULL)
    for number of piped commands:
        fork_and_chain():
            create new process
            if given command has redirection
                redirect_and_exec():
                  check for input or output redirection:
                    if input 
                        open file descriptor and set up input
                    if output
                        is it > or >>?
                        open file descriptor based on overwrite or append
                    exec command now with possible input and output rediections set up
